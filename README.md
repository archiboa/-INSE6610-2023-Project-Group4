**Description:**

Welcome to our group project in Cybercrime Investigation! This project focuses on conducting a survey and implementing an attack against our own Onion service for the purpose of deanonymization. We will explore various techniques to uncover the identity and location of an Onion service, which is hosted on the Tor network.

**Project Goals:**

1. Understand the concept of Tor and Onion services.
2. Explore deanonymization techniques used to uncover the identity and location of an Onion service.
3. Implement an attack against our own Onion service to evaluate its vulnerability.
4. Analyze and document the results of the attack.
5. Present our findings and recommendations for improving the security of Onion services.

**Communication:**

Regular communication is crucial for the success of our group project. We will use the following channels:

1. Meetings: Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and make important decisions.
2. Allocate roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth coordination.
3. Collaboration Tools: Utilize project management and collaboration tools (e.g., GitHub, Trello, Slack) to facilitate communication, track tasks, and share project-related resources.
4. Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each stage of the project, including research findings, attack methodologies, and results.
   
**Project Timeline:**

The project will be divided into the following phases with their respective deadlines:

**Research and Planning: Week 1**

Conduct background research on Tor, Onion services, and deanonymization techniques.
Create a detailed plan outlining the attack methodology and experiment setup.

**Implementation and Testing: Weeks 2-4**

Implement the selected deanonymization technique(s).
Conduct thorough testing and record the obtained results.
Address any issues or challenges encountered during implementation.

**Analysis and Documentation: Weeks 5-6**

Analyze the collected data and evaluate the success of the attack.
Document the attack methodology, modifications made, and their impact on the results.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings.

**Presentation and Finalization: Week 7**

Prepare a visually engaging presentation to showcase our project.
Review and finalize all project deliverables.
Practice the presentation to ensure a clear and cohesive delivery.

**Resources:**

The following resources may be helpful for our project:

1. Tor Project: Official website of the Tor Project with information about the Tor network and Onion services.
2. Research papers and articles on Tor and deanonymization techniques.
3. Online forums and communities dedicated to cybersecurity and Tor.
4. Remember to cite and credit any external resources used in our project to maintain academic integrity.

**Conclusion:**

This group project aims to deepen our understanding of deanonymization techniques used in cybercrime investigations on the Tor network. By implementing an attack against our own Onion service, we will gain practical insights into the vulnerabilities and risks associated with such services. Let's work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and strive for excellence in our research and analysis. 

Goodluck Everyone!
